                This is a 17 year old version of me (I am not much older than that now but perhaps sometime in the future when i visit this website i will remember things).
                My name is Saketh. I am a dude from Bengaluru currently studying in IIIT Hyderabad for my degree in BTech/Ms dual degree in Computer Science.
                I have varied interests in sports like tennis, football and cricket, music like pop, hip-hop and RnB, and arts like pencil shading.
                I love playing tennis, hanging out with friends, and occasionally love to sit for hours and do a nice pencil sketch.

                Im not a singer or dancer, thought if im surrounded with 
                a group of friends who are dancing, I can pull a couple of dance moves.
                I especially love dancing when there is no preperation, just freestyling witha group of friends who are also freestyling.

                As of late, my most time spent on youtube is listening to 
                pop music criticism online. Certain creators like Todd in the shadows, TheDoubleAgent, Anthony Fantano, 
                DiamondAxeStudios have pumped out some of my favourite videos tackling the subject of music.

                Of course, I spend a lot of time learning new things 
                from channels like veritasium, 3b1b, about more general topics and math.

                I love spending time on cooking. Making sandwiches for snacks is my 
                favourite way to spend time. Other than that, I love watching cooking
                shows like Hell's Kitchen, and Masterchef.
